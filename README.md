# Scripts Repository
======
This repository is to store some well-elaborated scripts to use in my everyday research life. Some of them may be
interested to others.

## top2psf.pl
------
This perl script is written by Marc Baaden to transfer GROMACS topology file or PDB file to psf file for other use
usage: `top2psf.pl -p input.top [-P input.pdb] -o output.psf`

I am working on transfering this perl script to python version to make compatible with my own script
## catpsf.py
------
This python script is to concatenate multiple psf files generated by `top2psf.pl`, with several options to include
usage: `catpsf.py -p inputlist -w #ofsolventmol -o output.psf`

## geninp_g16.py
------
This python script is to build gaussian 16 input file from extracted PDB file, for both DFT and semi-empirical ZINDO
calcualtions. 
For protein ET, bridges are usually amino acid sidechains, we replace alpha-C with hydrogen to cap the sidechain as
single molecule to include in QM calculations
usage: `geninp_g16.py -p input.pdb -n nprocshared -m memory -o output`
