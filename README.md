# Scripts Repository
This repository is to store some well-elaborated scripts to use in my everyday research life. Some of them may be
interested to others.

## top2psf.pl
This perl script is written by Marc Baaden to transfer GROMACS topology file or PDB file to psf file for other use

usage: `top2psf.pl -p input.top [-P input.pdb] -o output.psf`

I am working on transfering this perl script to python version to make compatible with my own script

## catpsf.py
This python script is to concatenate multiple psf files generated by `top2psf.pl`, with several options to include

usage: `catpsf.py -p inputlist -w #ofsolventmol -o output.psf`

## top2psf.py
This is a working python script that have similar function as Marc's perl script, top2psf.pl, to transfer GROMACS topology file to psf file for
other use. (Right now we only support transferring atom and bond information to psf file)

usage: `top2psf.py -p input.top -o output.psf`

## geninp_g16.py
This python script is to build gaussian 16 input file from extracted PDB file, for both DFT and semi-empirical ZINDO
calcualtions. 

For protein ET, bridges are usually amino acid sidechains, we replace alpha-C with hydrogen to cap the sidechain as
single molecule to include in QM calculations, and further specific feature is included in -s option

usage: `geninp_g16.py -p input.pdb -n nprocshared -m memory -s specific_feature -o output` 

## g16geninp.py
This python script is to build template gaussian 16 input file from extracted PDB file, in a clean and compact version comparing to previous
`geninp_g16.py`

usage: `g16geninp.py -p input -n nprocshared -m memory -s specific_feature [-nt nterminal -ct cterminal] -o output`

## calHda_BD.py
This python script is to calculate electronic coupling based on Block Diagonalization method.

usage: `calHda_BD.py -f fock -s overlap -nb #ofbasis -ne #ofelectron -o output_prefix`

## calHda_GMH.py
This python script is to calculate electronic coupling based on orbital-based GMH method.

usage: `calHda_GMH.py -f fock -s overlap [-m MO_coefficient] -d dipole [-no orbitals -al acceptor_list -dl donor_list -ml mo_list --length_threshold threshold]-o output`
